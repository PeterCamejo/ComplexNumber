A complex number class written in C++. The class takes in two parameters, realNum and imgNum, which correspond to a complex 
number's real number and imaginary number respectively.

Example: 
Complex complex(4,5);

The new Complex object, complex, equates to the complex number 4 + 5i .

The class contains every basic complex number operation, including:
 
Each mathematical operator (+, - , *, /= , += , etc.)
Each comparison operator (< , <= , == , != , etc.)
A complexFromPolar function, which takes in the Rho and Theta of a complex number in polar form and converts it to the
real number + imaginary number form that the class uses.
